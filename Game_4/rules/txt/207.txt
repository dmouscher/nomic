Rule 207/0

An active player becomes inactive (i.e. loses their active status) if any of the following criteria are met:

* It is the active player’s turn, and said player has not made a proposal by the end of their turn

* It is not the active player’s turn, a proposal has been put forward during the turn, and said player has not voted on said proposal by the end of the turn

* The active player has publicly declared that they are now inactive

Players that have become inactive through the above methods may become active again by attempting to cast a vote (the vote will be counted as though it was cast when they were active) or by publicly declaring that they are active.

Players may declare inactivity during their turn. The turn will not end immediately, but any proposal made during the turn is treated as though it does not exist. A player that declares inactivity during their turn cannot become active for the duration of said turn.

If an inactive player’s turn would start, their turn is skipped instead.
