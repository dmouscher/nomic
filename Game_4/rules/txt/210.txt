Rule 210/1

Proposals may not be edited after they are submitted for voting. A proposal may be resubmitted up to two times a turn but may not be resubmitted if the turn has started more than 24 hours ago. Resubmitting a proposal restarts the vote on the proposal.

If at the 24hr mark of a turn if 75% of the votes for the current proposal have the word "extend" (not case sensitive) then the current turn is extended another 24hrs, the current player can propose an additional time, and they are allowed to proposal up to 48hrs after their turn is started
