Nomitron is a bot-player.

If all active players have a current & unambiguous vote on a rule-change, the player proposing the rule-change has used all of their re-proposals, and there is a tie, Nomitron will roll 1d3.

1) If Nomitron rolls a one, Nomitron votes yay.
2) If Nomitron rolls a two, Nomitron votes nay.
3) If Nomitron rolls a three, Nomitron does not vote.

This roll can only happen once a turn. If the circumstances triggering Nomitronâ€™s roll are re-reached after the initial roll, it will not trigger an additional roll.
