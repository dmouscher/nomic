# NOMIC IV RULESET (LONG FORMAT)
---
## 101/0 (IMMUTABLE)

All players must always abide by all the rules then in effect, in the form in which they are then in effect. The rules in the Initial Set are in effect whenever a game begins. The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-117 (immutable) and 201-219 (mutable).

##### *History*

[*Initial immutable Rule 101, Jun 1, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f717212bdda11bd4441cf6fdac878ce8d2112f10/Game_4/rules/md/101.md)

## 102/0 (IMMUTABLE)

Initially rules in the 100's are immutable and rules in the 200's are mutable. Rules subsequently enacted or transmuted (that is, changed from immutable to mutable or vice versa) may be immutable or mutable regardless of their numbers, and rules in the Initial Set may be transmuted regardless of their numbers.

##### *History*

[*Initial immutable Rule 102, Jun 1, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f717212bdda11bd4441cf6fdac878ce8d2112f10/Game_4/rules/md/102.md)

## 103/0 (IMMUTABLE)

A rule-change is any of the following: (1) the enactment, repeal, or amendment of a mutable rule; (2) the enactment, repeal, or amendment of an amendment of a mutable rule; or (3) the transmutation of an immutable rule into a mutable rule or vice versa.

##### *History*

[*Initial immutable Rule 103, Jun 1, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f717212bdda11bd4441cf6fdac878ce8d2112f10/Game_4/rules/md/103.md)

## 104/0 (IMMUTABLE)

All rule-changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on. They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required number of votes.

##### *History*

[*Initial immutable Rule 104, Jun 1, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f717212bdda11bd4441cf6fdac878ce8d2112f10/Game_4/rules/md/104.md)

## 105/0 (IMMUTABLE)

All proposed rule-changes shall be written down before they are voted on. If they are adopted, they shall guide play in the form in which they were voted on.

##### *History*

[*Initial immutable Rule 105, Jun 1, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f717212bdda11bd4441cf6fdac878ce8d2112f10/Game_4/rules/md/105.md)

## 106/0 (IMMUTABLE)

No rule-change may take effect earlier than the moment of the completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording explicitly states otherwise. No rule-change may have retroactive application.

##### *History*

[*Initial immutable Rule 106, Jun 1, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f717212bdda11bd4441cf6fdac878ce8d2112f10/Game_4/rules/md/106.md)

## 107/0 (IMMUTABLE)

Each proposed rule-change shall be given a number for reference. The numbers shall begin with 301, and each rule-change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next successive integer, whether or not the proposal is adopted.

When a rule-change is adopted in the proper way, the rule it enacts receives said rule-change’s number.

##### *History*

[*Initial immutable Rule 107, Jun 1, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f717212bdda11bd4441cf6fdac878ce8d2112f10/Game_4/rules/md/107.md)

## 108/0 (IMMUTABLE)

Rule-changes that transmute immutable rules into mutable rules may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among the eligible voters. Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be stated explicitly in a proposal to take effect.

##### *History*

[*Initial immutable Rule 108, Jun 1, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f717212bdda11bd4441cf6fdac878ce8d2112f10/Game_4/rules/md/108.md)

## 109/0 (IMMUTABLE)

In a conflict between a mutable and an immutable rule, the immutable rule takes precedence and the mutable rule shall be entirely void. For the purposes of this rule a proposal to transmute an immutable rule does not "conflict" with that immutable rule.

##### *History*

[*Initial immutable Rule 109, Jun 1, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f717212bdda11bd4441cf6fdac878ce8d2112f10/Game_4/rules/md/109.md)

## 110/0 (IMMUTABLE)

A player always has the option to forfeit the game rather than continue to play or incur a game penalty. No penalty worse than losing, in the judgment of the player to incur it, may be imposed.

##### *History*

[*Initial immutable Rule 110, Jun 1, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f717212bdda11bd4441cf6fdac878ce8d2112f10/Game_4/rules/md/110.md)

## 111/0 (IMMUTABLE)

The adoption of rule-changes must never become completely impermissible.

##### *History*

[*Initial immutable Rule 111, Jun 1, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f717212bdda11bd4441cf6fdac878ce8d2112f10/Game_4/rules/md/111.md)

## 112/0 (IMMUTABLE)

Rule-changes that directly or indirectly affect the methods by which the rules are changed are as permissible as other rule-changes.

##### *History*

[*Initial immutable Rule 112, Jun 1, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f717212bdda11bd4441cf6fdac878ce8d2112f10/Game_4/rules/md/112.md)

## 113/0 (IMMUTABLE)

Rules can change their own text or repeal themselves. Rules cannot make any other changes to the rules unless the explicit authority for such a change is already present.

##### *History*

[*Initial immutable Rule 113, Jun 1, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f717212bdda11bd4441cf6fdac878ce8d2112f10/Game_4/rules/md/113.md)

## 114/0 (IMMUTABLE)

Votes must be unambiguous. A vote that would be ambiguous is not considered to be a vote. Additional rules may be made to clarify what constitutes ambiguity.

##### *History*

[*Initial immutable Rule 114, Jun 1, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f717212bdda11bd4441cf6fdac878ce8d2112f10/Game_4/rules/md/114.md)

## 115/0 (IMMUTABLE)

Server administrators and moderators regulate the server and game. Their responsibilities include the creation of text and voice channels, the designation of which messages and actions go in which channels, the editing or deleting of messages that are inappropriate for the channel that they are in, and keeping track of the state of the game. The server administrator may override the decision of a server moderator, and may grant and revoke moderator status to persons.

A person is a server administrator if and only if they have the "Administrator" role. A person is a server moderator if and only if they have the "Moderator" role.

##### *History*

[*Initial immutable Rule 115, Jun 1, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f717212bdda11bd4441cf6fdac878ce8d2112f10/Game_4/rules/md/115.md)

## 116/0 (IMMUTABLE)

All actions, including voting and rule-change proposals, must occur in the channel or channels that are designated for them. Any action that does not occur in said action’s designated channel is not considered a valid action.

##### *History*

[*Initial immutable Rule 116, Jun 1, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f717212bdda11bd4441cf6fdac878ce8d2112f10/Game_4/rules/md/116.md)

## 117/0 (IMMUTABLE)

Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a rule is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the rules, which is permitted only when a rule or set of rules explicitly or implicitly permits it.

##### *History*

[*Initial immutable Rule 117, Jun 1, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f717212bdda11bd4441cf6fdac878ce8d2112f10/Game_4/rules/md/117.md)

##### *Judgments*

*"Regulated" means that concepts explained in the rules cannot have arbitrary actions taken upon them unless explicitly permitted by the rules. (Coconutpies), Jun 6, 2020 (R1T3)*

## 201/0

Players shall initially alternate in a random order to be determined by the server administrator by the start of the game, taking one whole turn apiece. Players joining the game will have their turn order set to precede the player that is taking their turn at the time of the player’s joining. Turns belonging to active players may not be skipped or passed, and parts of turns belonging to active players may not be omitted. All players begin with zero points.

##### *History*

[*Initial mutable Rule 201, Jun 1, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f717212bdda11bd4441cf6fdac878ce8d2112f10/Game_4/rules/md/201.md)

## 202/0

One turn consists of proposing one rule-change and having it voted on.

##### *History*

[*Initial mutable Rule 202, Jun 1, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f717212bdda11bd4441cf6fdac878ce8d2112f10/Game_4/rules/md/202.md)

## 203/1

A rule-change is adopted if a simple majority of eligible voters vote for it. This majority must be more than 15% of total players.

##### *History*

[*Initial mutable Rule 203, Jun 1, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f717212bdda11bd4441cf6fdac878ce8d2112f10/Game_4/rules/md/203.md)  
[*Amended (1) by Proposal 329 (Alekosen), Jul 27, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f743617b929b6bc54e72b85fa9d282c30fe6a65b/Game_4/rules/md/203.md)

## 204/0

An adopted rule-change takes full effect at the moment of the start of the turn following the turn that it was adopted on.

##### *History*

[*Initial mutable Rule 204, Jun 1, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f717212bdda11bd4441cf6fdac878ce8d2112f10/Game_4/rules/md/204.md)

## 205/0

Every active player is an eligible voter. Every eligible voter must participate in every vote on rule-changes.

##### *History*

[*Initial mutable Rule 205, Jun 1, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f717212bdda11bd4441cf6fdac878ce8d2112f10/Game_4/rules/md/205.md)

## 206/1

The length of a turn defaults to 24 hours. If the player whose turn it is has made a proposal, the length of the turn is extended by 24 more hours. If, at the 24-hour mark of a turn, all active players have cast an unwithdrawn vote on the current revision of the proposal, and Judgment has not been invoked during said turn, the above extension is revoked and the turn ends immediately.

##### *History*

[*Initial mutable Rule 206, Jun 1, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f717212bdda11bd4441cf6fdac878ce8d2112f10/Game_4/rules/md/206.md)  
[*Amended (1) by Proposal 311 (Crorem), Jun 23, 2020 (R1T11)*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/1a312b472fc5530a3a40a069cdd116ba5414b82f/Game_4/rules/md/206.md)

## 207/0

An active player becomes inactive (i.e. loses their active status) if any of the following criteria are met:
* It is the active player’s turn, and said player has not made a proposal by the end of their turn
* It is not the active player’s turn, a proposal has been put forward during the turn, and said player has not voted on said proposal by the end of the turn
* The active player has publicly declared that they are now inactive

Players that have become inactive through the above methods may become active again by attempting to cast a vote (the vote will be counted as though it was cast when they were active) or by publicly declaring that they are active.

Players may declare inactivity during their turn. The turn will not end immediately, but any proposal made during the turn is treated as though it does not exist. A player that declares inactivity during their turn cannot become active for the duration of said turn.

If an inactive player’s turn would start, their turn is skipped instead.

##### *History*

[*Initial mutable Rule 207, Jun 1, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f717212bdda11bd4441cf6fdac878ce8d2112f10/Game_4/rules/md/207.md)

## 208/0

Each player always has exactly one vote.

##### *History*

[*Initial mutable Rule 208, Jun 1, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f717212bdda11bd4441cf6fdac878ce8d2112f10/Game_4/rules/md/208.md)

## 209/0

Players may change or withdraw their votes by stating their intention to do so. Players may not edit or delete their votes (*i.e.* alter the voting record). A vote that is edited loses its vote status.

##### *History*

[*Initial mutable Rule 209, Jun 1, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f717212bdda11bd4441cf6fdac878ce8d2112f10/Game_4/rules/md/209.md)

## 210/1

Proposals may not be edited after they are submitted for voting. A proposal may be resubmitted up to two times a turn but may not be resubmitted if the turn has started more than 24 hours ago. Resubmitting a proposal restarts the vote on the proposal.

If at the 24hr mark of a turn if 75% of the votes for the current proposal have the word "extend" (not case sensitive) then the current turn is extended another 24hrs, the current player can propose an additional time, and they are allowed to proposal up to 48hrs after their turn is started

##### *History*

[*Initial mutable Rule 210, Jun 1, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f717212bdda11bd4441cf6fdac878ce8d2112f10/Game_4/rules/md/210.md)  
[*Amended (1) by Proposal 328 (THUNDER THIGHS), Jul 24, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/fc89eb98e398d22eed3d3c3d39b8a810a11d0f0f/Game_4/rules/md/210.md)
## 211/0

If a section of a rule relies on a bot to be implemented to the point where its manual implementation would be infeasible, and there is no such bot, then said rule’s section is void until said bot is functional.

##### *History*

[*Initial mutable Rule 211, Jun 1, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f717212bdda11bd4441cf6fdac878ce8d2112f10/Game_4/rules/md/211.md)

## 212/0

At the end of a player's turn, 1d6 points are added to their score.

##### *History*

[*Initial mutable Rule 212, Jun 1, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f717212bdda11bd4441cf6fdac878ce8d2112f10/Game_4/rules/md/212.md)

## 213/0

The winner is the first player to achieve 100 (positive) points.

##### *History*

[*Initial mutable Rule 213, Jun 1, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f717212bdda11bd4441cf6fdac878ce8d2112f10/Game_4/rules/md/213.md)

## 214/0

If two or more mutable rules conflict with one another, or if two or more immutable rules conflict with one another, then the rule with the lowest ordinal number takes precedence.

If at least one of the rules in conflict explicitly says of itself that it defers to another rule (or type of rule) or takes precedence over another rule (or type of rule), then such provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining precedence.

If two or more rules claim to take precedence over one another or to defer to one another, then the numerical method again governs.

##### *History*

[*Initial mutable Rule 214, Jun 1, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f717212bdda11bd4441cf6fdac878ce8d2112f10/Game_4/rules/md/214.md)

## 215/0

If players disagree about the legality of a move or the interpretation or application of a rule, then the active player preceding the one moving is to be the Judge and decide the question. Disagreement for the purposes of this rule may be created by the insistence of any player. This process is called invoking Judgment.

When Judgment is invoked for the first time in a turn, the current turn is extended by 24 hours unless the scheduled end of the turn was already more than 24 hours after Judgment’s invocation. If the turn is extended in this manner, and there are still more than 24 hours left in the turn, a majority of active players may consent to revoke the extension.

The Judge's Judgment may be overruled only by either a unanimous vote of the other active players taken before the next turn is begun or the server administrator before the next turn is begun. If a Judge's Judgment is overruled, then the active player preceding the Judge in the playing order becomes the new Judge for the question, and so on, except that no player is to be Judge during his or her own turn or during the turn of a team-mate.

The server administrator can only overrule a Judge’s Judgment if the Judgment egregiously conflicts with the rules and would cause lasting damage to the game. A majority vote of the other active players, taken before the next turn is begun, may nullify the overruling, in which case the original Judgment stands, the original Judge resumes their position as Judge, all Judgments issued by Judges between the overruling and the nullification of the overruling are nullified, and the server administrator is barred from overruling the Judge for the remainder of the turn.

Unless a Judge is overruled, one Judge settles all questions arising from the game until the next turn is begun, including questions as to his or her own legitimacy and jurisdiction as Judge.

New Judges are not bound by the decisions of old Judges. New Judges may, however, settle only those questions on which the players currently disagree and that affect the completion of the turn in which Judgment was invoked. All decisions by Judges shall be in accordance with all the rules then in effect; but when the rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the point at issue, then the Judge shall consider game-custom and the spirit of the game before applying other standards.

##### *History*

[*Initial mutable Rule 215, Jun 1, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f717212bdda11bd4441cf6fdac878ce8d2112f10/Game_4/rules/md/215.md)

## 216/0

The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered from achieving *n* points to any other state of affairs. The magnitude of *n* and the means of earning points may be changed, and rules that establish a winner when play cannot continue may be enacted and (while they are mutable) be amended or repealed.

##### *History*

[*Initial mutable Rule 216, Jun 1, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f717212bdda11bd4441cf6fdac878ce8d2112f10/Game_4/rules/md/216.md)

## 217/0

If the rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or if the legality of a move cannot be determined with finality, or if by the Judge's best reasoning, not overruled, a move appears equally legal and illegal, then the first player unable to complete a turn is the winner.

This rule takes precedence over every other rule determining the winner.

##### *History*

[*Initial mutable Rule 217, Jun 1, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f717212bdda11bd4441cf6fdac878ce8d2112f10/Game_4/rules/md/217.md)

## 218/0

Persons wishing to become players may request to do so publicly. Within 24 hours of the request, if no player has publicly objected or privately objected (to a server moderator or administrator) to a player joining the game, that player will join the game. If a player has objected, a vote is immediately held on whether or not the person joins the game. If there is a majority vote in favor after 24 hours of the start of the vote, that player will join the game.

Persons may not pretend to be multiple players at once. Persons that are found to have done this are banned from the game.

##### *History*

[*Initial mutable Rule 218, Jun 1, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f717212bdda11bd4441cf6fdac878ce8d2112f10/Game_4/rules/md/218.md)

## 219/1

Players that are required by the rules to perform an action have a total of 48 hours to perform said action unless otherwise specified. A player that does not perform said action within the allotted 48 hours becomes inactive until either they do perform said action or said action becomes impossible to perform.

##### *History*

[*Initial mutable Rule 219, Jun 1, 2020*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/f717212bdda11bd4441cf6fdac878ce8d2112f10/Game_4/rules/md/219.md)

## 303/0

Proposals are not allowed to distinguish those who voted for it, those who voted against it, or those who did not vote on it from each other.

##### *History*

[*Enacted by Proposal 303 (THUNDER THIGHS), Jun 7, 2020 (R1T3)*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/1ca88db74ef06ce6bfccdc8862ebf0083f84bbde/Game_4/rules/md/303.md)

## 304/0

Upon the event that players do not have an idea for a proposal, on their turn they can invoke a phone a friend action in the actions channel requesting ideas for proposals to submit. This action must be invoked in the first 12 hours of a players turn. Other players can then suggest ideas for a proposal. Other players are limited to submitting 1 suggestion, and these suggestions must be unique from others for this turn. A random suggestion is taken for a proposal, this is done 12 hours after the phone a friend action. If there is a question raised of the “uniqueness” of suggestions, judgement must be invoked, and all but the earliest suggestion will be thrown out. The picked suggestion is posted with an @ to the current player, and they have the option of taking the suggestion word for word, or editing it then posting to the voting channel. If a suggestion is taken word for word suggester gains 3 points upon a passed proposal, or they lose 1 point upon the failure of the proposal.  If a suggestion is taken but not copy and pasted, the suggestor gains 1 point upon success, and nothing upon failure. If at any point the current player comes up with their own idea for a proposal so long as it is unique to all suggestions posted, then that player may scrap all suggestions and propose their own idea.

[*Enacted by Proposal 304 (Janwich), Jun 9, 2020 (R1T4)*](https://github.com/dmouscher/nomic/blob/1d7cdcd61b0060da37f060f0d700c84756ce2463/Game_4/rules/md/304.md)

## 305/1

The Political Compass is a 801x801 grid. Four ideological groups control the corners of the grid. Pagan Trans-Humanists control the top left corner, (-400, 400), Lovecraftian Eco-Fascists control the top right corner, (400, 400), Raccoon Gamer-Warlords control the bottom left corner, (-400, -400), and Norse Warrior-Shamans control the bottom right corner, (400, -400). An indicator puck begins on (0, 0).

Players are randomly and evenly distributed to each ideology. New players are distributed to a random ideology among those with the least players. Two players can swap teams if both players unambiguously consent to the swap, but players cannot otherwise change ideology. Players can make this swap once per round.

If *x* players in an ideology vote on a proposal, the indicator puck moves two points towards their corner, (or one point if the puck has reached their corner before), both horizontally and vertically. This can happen up to once per turn per ideology. The first time a player proposes a rule-change on their turn, the indicator puck moves one point towards their ideology’s corner, both horizontally and vertically. This can happen up to *x* times per round for a single ideology. In both cases, *x* is equal to the larger of either A) the smallest number *n* such that every ideology has at least *n* active players, or B) 2.

Each ideology has an end-goal, which is activated when the indicator puck reaches their corner. This causes all members of that ideology to gain 35 points and resets the indicator puck.

Each ideology has a power. Members of an ideology must vote in #actions to decide to use their power. The power is only used if at least 2/3rds of the active players in the ideology vote in favor of using it. Powers have a 5-day cooldown. The cost of each power moves the indicator puck the listed distance. Power effects that alter aspects of other powers or mechanics supersede the original descriptions of said powers or mechanics. A player cannot be affected by the same power more than once at the same time.

#### Pagan Trans-Humanists

End-Goal: Upload all players to the cloud via witchcraft, and also, the “cloud” part isn’t a metaphor, there's a massive techno-magic cloud that everyone gets to hang out in.

Power Name: r/pan’s Labyrinth  
Power Description: Force a player to undergo testing for cloud-compatibility.  
Power Cost: (+5, -4)  
Power Effect: When another ideology’s power is used, it has an *x*/*n* chance of backfiring and targeting itself, where *x* is the number of players in said ideology who are currently affected by “r/pan’s Labyrinth,” and *n* is the number of players in said ideology. When a power backfires in this manner, the effect is removed from **all** players.

#### Lovecraftian Eco-Fascists

End-Goal: Summon C’Thussolini to annihilate humanity, thereby restoring balance to nature, and most importantly, have fun while doing it.

Power Name: Sieg-Oh-Hell-No  
Power Description: Force a player to pick up litter at tank-point.  
Power Cost: (-4, -5)  
Power Effect: Targeted player’s ideology’s power has an additional 8 days on its cooldown the next time it is used.  

#### Raccoon Gamer-Warlords

When this rule passes, each player is given 5 random words. (https://wordcounter.net/random-word-generator)

At the end of a player's turn, the player is given 5 random words. If a player has more than 25 words, they must discrard words until they have no more than 25 words.  
Groups or individuals of players may combine words to create a temporary rule in #Actions. Once used in a temporary rule, the player cannot use that word again, unless randomly assigned it again. Temporary rules must contain 3 or more words from a player's randomly given word list.

Temporary rules are not rules, but become rules on the next turn, or if the turn ends in less then 24 hours, the turn after that.

Words may be modified to fit gramatically, but the root word meaning must be retained.  
Punctuation as well as numerical characters 0 to 9 may be used freely.  
The following words may be used without players having them:  
the, be, to, of, and, a, in, that, have, it, for, not, on, with, as, you, do, at, this, but, by, from, they, we, or, will, all, there, their, what, so, if, when, can, no, into, some, can, other, than, then

By default rules created from temporary rules may not superceed other rules, and are numbered 600's and above.  
This rule superceed all previous rules.

This rule has the authority to repeal rules created from temporary rules.  
Changes to this rule, can cause ammendments or removal of rules created from temporary rules.  
Rules created from temporary rules that, either by general consensus or by the Judge's reasoning, are paradoxical, create a situation that has an ambiguous legality, or are too vague to be resolved with confidence are repealed.

A vote may be invoked in #actions to destroy a temporary rule before it becomes a rule. Once invoked, players have untill the end of the next day (24-48hrs) to vote. At the end of the time period (midnight), if a 65% majority agree, the temprory rule is destroyed, else the temproary rule becomes a rule at the end of the current turn.

All players have an individual emoji list. Once every round, players can add, swap, or remove an emoji from their emoji list by declaring so in #actions. All emojis in a player's emoji list are added at the end of said player's name.

Players must have at least one emoji in their emoji list, and are required to add an emoji to their emoji list if it is empty. Players cannot remove an emoji from their emoji list if doing so would cause their emoji list to become empty.

#### Battleship:  
Each player will have their own 10x10 grid that they have to place 5 ships. Horizontal coordinates are the first 10 letters of the alphabet, and vertical are 1-10  
1. Carrier with size 5  
2. Battleship with size 4  
3. Destroyer with size 3  
4. Submarine with size 3  
5. Patrol Boat with size 2

Each of these ships has a width of 1 and a length of its size. They can be oriented horizontally or vertically so that it takes up consecutive grid spots equal to the size of the ship. Ships may touch, but cannot occupy the same grid square as another.

Players face off in 1v1s by challenging publicly in actions and both players agreeing to play. Players may only be playing against one other player.

After bombing, a current board is displayed with X's in bombing locations without a ship, and O's where a bomb hit a ship.

Players can only target the player they are paired against with bombs. Players can bomb twice per turn. If a player does not bomb for 3 turns a player automatically forfeits.

When a player in a 1v1 has no more ships with unhit grid coordinates then the other player wins.

When a player wins a game they gain 2 points. Players can only gain points from battleship once every turn.

## 317/1

An action is a direct change to the state of the game. An action can be directly player-initiated or created as the result of an ability.

An ability is a property that each player may or may not have. Abilities create actions depending on what triggers that the ability has. Actions created by an ability are treated as though they were initiated by the originator of said ability.

An action is either an inalienable action or an actionable action. Actionable actions are further divided into immediate actionable action and delayed actionable actions. Abilities have the same classification. An ability of any given type will create actions with the corresponding type.

Action stacks are stacks that delayed actionable actions are pushed on to, popped off from, or created in. Only delayed actionable actions may go on action stacks. If at any point a delayed actionable action on an action stack ceases to be a delayed actionable action, it is removed from its action stack. If the former delayed actionable action is still an action, it is simultaneously put into action.

When an action exerts its stated effect on the game, that action is said to be "put into action".

An inalienable action or an immediate actionable action is put into action the moment it is performed or created, and is irreversible save for Judgment that it was performed or created illegally. A delayed actionable action is pushed onto a specific action stack when it is performed or created. If an action stack and all of the actions that it contains have been unmodified for four consecutive hours, the action stack will pop actions until either a new action has been placed onto said action stack or said action stack is empty, at which point it is deleted. Actions popped in this manner are put into action unless they are blocked or don't meet their prerequisites at the time they are popped. Popped actions occur consecutively.

If an action has a cost, said cost must be paid to perform said action. Costs to perform an action are paid the moment said action is performed and are not part of the action itself. Paying a cost to perform an action is itself an immediate actionable action.

While on its action stack, a delayed actionable action may be blocked, removed, copied, or modified by other actions that target said delayed actionable action.

* When an action that blocks a target delayed actionable action is put into action, the target action is blocked
* When an action that removes a target delayed actionable action is put into action, the target action is removed from its action stack.
* When an action that copies a target delayed actionable action is put into action, a copy of the target action is pushed onto a specific stack. The copy of the action is identical to the target action at the time that it was copied, save that it is treated as though it was performed by the player who performed the action that copied the action that the copy of the action was copied from. 
* When an action that modifies a target delayed actionable action is put into action, the target action is modified as the targeting action specifies, keeping both its action stack and its placement on its action stack.

Actions may not target themselves. If an action that is put into action would target an action not on its action stack, it instead does nothing.

By default, performing or creating a delayed actionable action creates a new action stack and pushes said action onto it. A player can choose to push a newly-performed action of theirs on top of a preexisting action stack by specifying that they are doing so. Stating that an action is going on the same stack that some specific action is or was on is sufficient specification.

Performed or created actions that target a specific action automatically go on the same action stack as said specific action, any specification to the contrary notwithstanding. If an action targets actions on multiple action stacks, all action stacks containing action that said action targets are merged, and said action is pushed onto the merged stack. Actions in the merged stack are sorted chronologically, with the action created most recently on the top of the action stack and the action created least recently on the bottom of the action stack.

Copied delayed actionable action are put onto the same stack that they would be were the copied delayed actionable action a performed delayed actionable action, with the exception that the player who copied the copied delayed actionable action cannot choose to push said copied delayed actionable action onto an action stack with no action that said copied delayed actionable action targets.

All actions and abilities defined or regulated by the Initial Set (i.e. actions defined or regulated by any rule with a rule number less than 300) are classified as inalienable, while all other actions and abilities are classified as actionable. All actionable actions are immediate actionable actions unless otherwise stated, and all actionable abilities are immediate actionable abilities unless otherwise stated.

## 319/0

A Type is a property that may belong to a in-game entity or an action. Actions may have up to one Type. Non-action entities may have up to two Types. An entity or action that has at least one Type is said to be Typed.

The list of Types is as follows:

* Executive
* Legislative
* Judicial
* Bureaucratic
* Military
* Lobbyist
* Diplomat
* Journalist
* Pundit
* Delegate

Any given Type is either super effective, not very effective, or normally effective against any other given type. By default, one Type is normally effective against a second Type. The Type Chart, displayed below, indicates the effectiveness of the first type (left) against the second type (top):

![319 graph](images/319.png)

Types bestow their effectiveness properties on the entities that have them; a Typed action targeting a Typed entity with one Type where the action's Type is super effective against entity's Type is considered to be super effective against the entity itself, and likewise for not very effective Types.

If a Typed entity with two Types is targeted by a Typed action, and the action's Type is super effective against one of the entity's Types but not very effective against the other, said action is to be considered normally effective against said entity. Similarly, if the action's Type is super effective against both of the entity's Types, said action is to be considered super super effective against said entity, and if the action's Type is not very effective against both of the entity's Types, said action is to be considered very not very effective against said entity.

## 325/1

#### Criminal Court:

If a player is formally accused of breaking a rule by a moderator, or by majority player agreement, then that player is given the status “*Suspicari Criminalibus*”. A player with the status *Suspicari Criminalibus* cannot perform any actionable actions save for those defined in this rule.

When a player is granted the status of *Suspicari Criminalibus*, a Criminal Judge is picked using the same method as Judges, *i.e.* the first eligible active player in reverse turn order, starting from the player preceding the player whose turn it currently is, is made Criminal Judge. A player is not eligible to be a Criminal Judge if they have a conflict of interest that would not allow them to be impartial. A player is not eligible to be Criminal Judge if they are the Prosecutor or the Defense. A player is not eligible to be Criminal Judge if they are Judge. A player is not eligible to be Judge if they are Criminal Judge, superseding Rule 215.

If the *Suspicari Criminalibus* was formally accused by a moderator, said moderator will be designated as Prosecutor. If not, a willing mod will be chosen as Prosecutor instead. The *Suspicari Criminalibus* will be designated as the Defense. A player is not eligible to be Judge if they are the Prosecutor or Defense, superseding Rule 215. If the Prosecutor or Defense becomes Judge, the case is suspended until they are no longer Judge.

A court channel will be used for criminal proceedings. Only the Prosecutor, Defense, Criminal Judge, and any Appeals Judges may use the court channel. A Judge may also use the court channel if Judgment is currently invoked.

If the prosecutor proves beyond a reasonable doubt to the Criminal Judge that the Defense is guilty of breaking a rule, or if the Defense pleads guilty to the offense during or prior to the start of the trail, then the Defense is convicted of breaking said rule. It is the Criminal Judge’s job to then declare the Defendant’s guilt or innocence and, if the former was declared, assign a punishment.

The severity of a Criminal Judge’s punishment is largely dependent on the severity of the crime itself. On a guilty verdict, the Criminal Judge classifies the crime under one of three different categories:  
* Misdemeanors are the class of reversible crimes.
* Felonies are the class of irreversible crimes.
* War Crimes are the class of irreversible crimes that do excessive harm to the game. 

The Prosecutor and Defense take turns making opening statements, arguments, and closing statements. Opening statements, arguments, and closing statements must be submitted within 24 hours of the previous statement. A Prosecutor or Defense that fails to do so within the allotted time is considered to have made a blank statement at the end of the allotted time. Once closing statements are done, the Criminal Judge has 24 hours to make a verdict and post it. If 24 hours pass without such a verdict the Criminal Judge is considered to have automatically posted an innocent verdict.

After the verdict is posted roles of Criminal Judge, Prosecutor, Defense, and *Suspicari Criminalibus* are removed.

The following are established punishments to crimes, however, it is up to the Criminal Judge to augment or reduce punishment, taking into account the severity of the offense, whether or not the offense was a repeated one, the Defense’s plea, and other relevant context:  
* If the Defense is charged with a Misdemeanor, and the Misdemeanor is not a repeat offense, then they are given a warning.
* If the Defense is charged with a Misdemeanor, and the Misdemeanor is a repeat offense, then they are restricted in a manner to inhibit repetition of the crime, and a bail is posted. If this bail is paid, then the restrictions are removed. The length of time that a player is restricted may is up to the judge's prerogative. 
* If the Defense is charged with a Felony, and the Felony is not a repeat offense, then they are given a warning, temporary restriction or are somehow publicly shamed in a manner that does not impact the game state. Additionally, bail is posted. If this bail is paid, then the restrictions and/or humiliation are removed. 
* If the Defense is charged with a Felony, and the Felony is a repeat offense, then they are banned from performing actionable actions for a certain duration and fined. The player may be banned from Nomic if sufficient intent and malice are both demonstrated.
* All War Crimes are punishable by ban from Nomic or perpetual restrictions and extensive fines.

If new evidence comes to light or it was discovered that legal errors were made in a previous criminal trial, then an appeals court may be convened. The validity of convening an appeals court is determined by said appeals court. A player must formally request an appeals court be formed and present said new evidence or legal errors.

Following the request, three Appellate Judges are convened in an appeals court using the same method as a Criminal Judge, with the additional restriction that the Criminal Judge for the criminal trial being appealed cannot be an Appellate Judge. (The Prosecutor and Defense, for the purposes of convening Appellate Judges, are considered to be the same players that they were in the criminal trial being appealed.)

The Appellate Judges first must determine the validity of the appeal by majority vote.  
If said appeal is deemed valid then the criminal case referred to by the appeal is reopened with the same Prosecutor and Defense. The appeals court is then held exactly as a criminal court with the Appellate Judges taking the place of the Criminal Judge and with their verdict and sentencing decided by a majority vote between them. As with a Criminal Judge’s verdict, an Appellate Judge’s absence of a verdict after 24 hours of the closing statements is considered to be a vote for an innocent verdict.

All crimes are tried in accordance with the ruleset at the time said rule was broken. No crimes may be charged against a rule *ex post facto*. 

In the event that no one is eligible to be Judge for Judgment due to the restrictions on Judge eligibility in this rule, said restrictions are lifted for the duration of the turn.

In the event that not enough active players are available for a criminal court, then the case may be decided through Judgment, with the Judge taking place of the Criminal Judge for purposes of declaring a verdict and sentence and with no Prosecutor or Defense. A request to appeal a trial conducted in such a manner is automatically considered valid if sufficient players are available to fulfill a three-judge appeals court with prosecutor and defense.

In the event that not enough eligible players are available for an appeals court, then the number of Appellate Judges convened is reduced to one for said court. If there would still not be enough eligible players given a one-judge appeals court, then no appeal that would cause such an insufficiency may be considered until such time when this is no longer the case.

Only one criminal trial may be held at a time, be it a criminal court or an appeals court.

The Major Deck of Minor Arcana is an infinite deck of cards with infinite copies of the Minor Arcana. Cards in the Minor Arcana have one of four suits: Swords, Wands, Coins, and Cups, and have one of fourteen ranks, in ascending order: Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten, Page, Knight, Queen, King, Ace.

A card that is known to be either not in the Major Deck of Minor Arcana or in a specific position in the Major Deck of Minor Arcana is said to be fixed. If the location of a fixed card is changed such that it is not known where it is in the Major Deck of Minor Arcana, or if a card is never fixed in the first place, it is said to be unfixed. To actively unfix a card means to put it randomly back in the Major Deck of Minor Arcana.

Each unique card c in the Minor Arcana has relative weight *wc* = 2<sup>-*kc*</sup> where *kc* is equal to the number of copies of *c* that are currently fixed. When a card is fixed, it becomes unique card c with probability *wc*/*W*, where *W* is the sum of all relative weights.

Players start out with five cards in their hand, which is unordered. They can draw up to two additional cards, consecutively or simultaneously, at any point in their turn. At the end of their turn, if they have more than seven cards in their, hand, they must unfix cards in their hand until they have exactly seven cards in their hand.

If multiple cards are drawn simultaneously, each card will be fixed using the same weights, and weights and probabilities will be recalculated only after drawing is finished. All cards that players start with are considered to be drawn simultaneously.

## 330/1

Once per turn, a player may DISCARD a card onto a discard pile. The card at the top of the discard pile is fixed, with all other cards in the discard pile being unfixed.

To DISCARD, a player first draws a card from the top of the Major Deck of Minor Arcana, then puts one card in their hand on top of the discard pile.

The Pot is a collection of coins, starting empty. Players also start with 0 coins.

A deal is a period of time starting after the Pot is emptied (or, if the Pot had never been emptied, the enactment of this rule) and ending when the Pot is next emptied.

The following effects are take effect when a player discards a card, but before it is placed on the discard pile:  
* When a COIN card is DISCARDED, a number of coins equal to the DISCARDED card's rank, or 11 if the DISCARDED card is ranked higher than Ten, is added to the Pot
* When a SWORD card is DISCARDED, the top card of the discard pile is inserted into the Major Deck of Minor Arcana with its ordinal position from the top equal to the DISCARDED card's rank, or at the top if the DISCARDED card's rank is greater than Ten
* When a WAND card is DISCARDED, the top card is added to the hand of the player that DISCARDED the DISCARDED card.
* When a CUPS card is DISCARDED, the card in the Major Deck of Minor Arcana with the ordinal position from the top equal to the DISCARDED card's rank, or the top card in the Major Deck of Minor Arcana if the DISCARDED card's rank is greater than Ten, becomes fixed if it was unfixed and unfixed if it was fixed. This does not change the ordinal position of the cards above the specified card.

If a player has not DISCARDED a card on the current turn, that player may SUBMIT 5 cards from their hand. The SUBMITTED cards are unfixed.

At the end of the next turn after the first SUBMISSION since the Pot was last emptied, the player out of all the players who SUBMITTED during the current deal who can form the best five-card hand using the cards that they SUBMITTED during the current deal and the card presently on top of the discard pile wins the Pot, and gets all the coins in it. If two or more players have equally good hands, then they split the pot as evenly as possible, with the remaining coins prioritized to the players whose SUBMISSIONS this deal were the earliest. All players who SUBMITTED in this most recent deal then draw 3 cards simultaneously, and the next deal begins.

Hands are ranked as follows, in descending order. If a hand fits the criteria of two different categories, it is considered to be the higher category:  
* **Quintuplet**: All five cards in the hand have the same rank and suit
* **Quadruplet**: Four cards in the hand have the same rank and suit
* **Full family**: Three cards in the hand have one combination of rank and suit, with the two other cards in the hand having a different combination of rank and suit
* **Five of a kind**: All five cards in the hand have the same rank
* **Straight flush**: All five cards have sequential rank and the same suit
  * For the purposes of a straight flush, an Ace card may count as either ranked under a Two or above a King, but not both in the same hand
* **Triplet**: Three cards in the hand have the same rank and suit
* **Four of a kind**: Four cards in the hand have the same rank
* **Two twin**: Two cards in the hand have one combination of rank and suit, with two other cards in the hand having a different combination of rank and suit
* **Full house**: Three cards in the hand have one rank, with the two other cards in the hand having a different rank
* **Straight**: All five cards have sequential rank
  * For the purposes of a straight, an Ace card may count as either ranked under a Two or above a King, but not as both in the same hand
* **Flush**: All five cards have the same suit
* **Three of a kind**: Three cards in the hand have the same rank
* **One twin**: Two cards in the hand have the same rank and suit
* **Two pair**: Two cards in the hand have one rank, with two other cards in the hand having a different rank
* **One pair**: Two cards in the hand have the same rank
* **High card**: The hand does not meet any of the above criteria

Hands are further ranked by the ranks of their collections of same-ranked cards, first in order by the size of the collection and then by the rank of the collection. For example, a full house hand would be further ranked first by the rank of its triplet and then by the rank of its twin, while a two pair hand would be further ranked first by the rank of its higher-ranked pair, then by the rank of its lower-ranked pair, and finally by the rank of its remaining card.

A collection of same-ranked cards that is larger than one card must contribute to the overall rank of the hand in order to be treated as such. For example, a flush hand would be further ranked using only collections of size 1, while a one twin hand would only count its same-suit pair as a collection of size 2, regardless of the existence of any different-suited pair in the hand.

Straight hands and straight flush hands are instead further ranked by the highest-ranked card in the hand. If, for the purposes of the straight hand or straight flush hand, an Ace card was counted as having ranked under a Two, then it would likewise be considered as ranked under a Two when further ranking the hand.

At any time a player may convert four of their coins to a single point. This process is not reversible.

## 336/0

Any player can declare any other player 'stinky' at any time by spending one point.  
Users declared stinky will be marked with a special 'stinky' role, that changes role usernames to brown and grants access to the exclusive 'little stinkers' chat, while removing access from the equally exclusive 'squeaky sweeties', which is available to all non-stinky players.  
Players declared stinky cannot declare other players stinky, nor can they be declared unstinky, except by spending one point.  
At the end of the round, a random active player who is not stinky will be given a random number of points between one and six, this player will be immediately declared stinky.

## 338/0

Players may on any turn, once per round, request the removal of an emoji from the game. This request is done in #actions. A vote is then called in #actions  to determine if the emoji is removed or stays. Simple majority vote determines the outcome. The vote ends at the end of the current turn. A removal request cannot be made 6 hours before the end of a turn.
