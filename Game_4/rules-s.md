# NOMIC IV RULESET (SHORT FORMAT)
---
## 101 (IMMUTABLE)

All players must always abide by all the rules then in effect, in the form in which they are then in effect. The rules in the Initial Set are in effect whenever a game begins. The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-117 (immutable) and 201-219 (mutable).

## 102 (IMMUTABLE)

Initially rules in the 100's are immutable and rules in the 200's are mutable. Rules subsequently enacted or transmuted (that is, changed from immutable to mutable or vice versa) may be immutable or mutable regardless of their numbers, and rules in the Initial Set may be transmuted regardless of their numbers.

## 103 (IMMUTABLE)

A rule-change is any of the following: (1) the enactment, repeal, or amendment of a mutable rule; (2) the enactment, repeal, or amendment of an amendment of a mutable rule; or (3) the transmutation of an immutable rule into a mutable rule or vice versa.

## 104 (IMMUTABLE)

All rule-changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on. They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required number of votes.

## 105 (IMMUTABLE)

All proposed rule-changes shall be written down before they are voted on. If they are adopted, they shall guide play in the form in which they were voted on.

## 106 (IMMUTABLE)

No rule-change may take effect earlier than the moment of the completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording explicitly states otherwise. No rule-change may have retroactive application.

## 107 (IMMUTABLE)

Each proposed rule-change shall be given a number for reference. The numbers shall begin with 301, and each rule-change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next successive integer, whether or not the proposal is adopted.

When a rule-change is adopted in the proper way, the rule it enacts receives said rule-change’s number.

## 108 (IMMUTABLE)

Rule-changes that transmute immutable rules into mutable rules may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among the eligible voters. Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be stated explicitly in a proposal to take effect.

## 109 (IMMUTABLE)

In a conflict between a mutable and an immutable rule, the immutable rule takes precedence and the mutable rule shall be entirely void. For the purposes of this rule a proposal to transmute an immutable rule does not "conflict" with that immutable rule.

## 110 (IMMUTABLE)

A player always has the option to forfeit the game rather than continue to play or incur a game penalty. No penalty worse than losing, in the judgment of the player to incur it, may be imposed.

## 111 (IMMUTABLE)

The adoption of rule-changes must never become completely impermissible.

## 112 (IMMUTABLE)

Rule-changes that directly or indirectly affect the methods by which the rules are changed are as permissible as other rule-changes.

## 113 (IMMUTABLE)

Rules can change their own text or repeal themselves. Rules cannot make any other changes to the rules unless the explicit authority for such a change is already present.

## 114 (IMMUTABLE)

Votes must be unambiguous. A vote that would be ambiguous is not considered to be a vote. Additional rules may be made to clarify what constitutes ambiguity.

## 115 (IMMUTABLE)

Server administrators and moderators regulate the server and game. Their responsibilities include the creation of text and voice channels, the designation of which messages and actions go in which channels, the editing or deleting of messages that are inappropriate for the channel that they are in, and keeping track of the state of the game. The server administrator may override the decision of a server moderator, and may grant and revoke moderator status to persons.

A person is a server administrator if and only if they have the "Administrator" role. A person is a server moderator if and only if they have the "Moderator" role.

## 116 (IMMUTABLE)

All actions, including voting and rule-change proposals, must occur in the channel or channels that are designated for them. Any action that does not occur in said action’s designated channel is not considered a valid action.

## 117 (IMMUTABLE)

Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a rule is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the rules, which is permitted only when a rule or set of rules explicitly or implicitly permits it.

## 201

Players shall initially alternate in a random order to be determined by the server administrator by the start of the game, taking one whole turn apiece. Players joining the game will have their turn order set to precede the player that is taking their turn at the time of the player’s joining. Turns belonging to active players may not be skipped or passed, and parts of turns belonging to active players may not be omitted. All players begin with zero points.

## 202

One turn consists of proposing one rule-change and having it voted on.

## 203

A rule-change is adopted if and only if a simple majority of eligible voters vote for it.

## 204

An adopted rule-change takes full effect at the moment of the start of the turn following the turn that it was adopted on.

## 205

Every active player is an eligible voter. Every eligible voter must participate in every vote on rule-changes.

## 206

The length of a turn defaults to 24 hours. If the player whose turn it is has made a proposal, the length of the turn is extended by 24 more hours.

## 207

An active player becomes inactive (i.e. loses their active status) if any of the following criteria are met:
* It is the active player’s turn, and said player has not made a proposal by the end of their turn
* It is not the active player’s turn, a proposal has been put forward during the turn, and said player has not voted on said proposal by the end of the turn
* The active player has publicly declared that they are now inactive

Players that have become inactive through the above methods may become active again by attempting to cast a vote (the vote will be counted as though it was cast when they were active) or by publicly declaring that they are active.

Players may declare inactivity during their turn. The turn will not end immediately, but any proposal made during the turn is treated as though it does not exist. A player that declares inactivity during their turn cannot become active for the duration of said turn.

If an inactive player’s turn would start, their turn is skipped instead.

## 208

Each player always has exactly one vote.

## 209

Players may change or withdraw their votes by stating their intention to do so. Players may not edit or delete their votes (*i.e.* alter the voting record). A vote that is edited loses its vote status.

## 210

Proposals may not be edited after they are submitted for voting. A proposal may be resubmitted up to two times a turn but may not be resubmitted if the turn has started more than 24 hours ago. Resubmitting a proposal restarts the vote on the proposal.

## 211

If a section of a rule relies on a bot to be implemented to the point where its manual implementation would be infeasible, and there is no such bot, then said rule’s section is void until said bot is functional.

## 212

At the end of a player's turn, 1d6 points are added to their score.

## 213

The winner is the first player to achieve 100 (positive) points.

## 214

If two or more mutable rules conflict with one another, or if two or more immutable rules conflict with one another, then the rule with the lowest ordinal number takes precedence.

If at least one of the rules in conflict explicitly says of itself that it defers to another rule (or type of rule) or takes precedence over another rule (or type of rule), then such provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining precedence.

If two or more rules claim to take precedence over one another or to defer to one another, then the numerical method again governs.

## 215

If players disagree about the legality of a move or the interpretation or application of a rule, then the active player preceding the one moving is to be the Judge and decide the question. Disagreement for the purposes of this rule may be created by the insistence of any player. This process is called invoking Judgment.

When Judgment is invoked for the first time in a turn, the current turn is extended by 24 hours unless the scheduled end of the turn was already more than 24 hours after Judgment’s invocation. If the turn is extended in this manner, and there are still more than 24 hours left in the turn, a majority of active players may consent to revoke the extension.

The Judge's Judgment may be overruled only by either a unanimous vote of the other active players taken before the next turn is begun or the server administrator before the next turn is begun. If a Judge's Judgment is overruled, then the active player preceding the Judge in the playing order becomes the new Judge for the question, and so on, except that no player is to be Judge during his or her own turn or during the turn of a team-mate.

The server administrator can only overrule a Judge’s Judgment if the Judgment egregiously conflicts with the rules and would cause lasting damage to the game. A majority vote of the other active players, taken before the next turn is begun, may nullify the overruling, in which case the original Judgment stands, the original Judge resumes their position as Judge, all Judgments issued by Judges between the overruling and the nullification of the overruling are nullified, and the server administrator is barred from overruling the Judge for the remainder of the turn.

Unless a Judge is overruled, one Judge settles all questions arising from the game until the next turn is begun, including questions as to his or her own legitimacy and jurisdiction as Judge.

New Judges are not bound by the decisions of old Judges. New Judges may, however, settle only those questions on which the players currently disagree and that affect the completion of the turn in which Judgment was invoked. All decisions by Judges shall be in accordance with all the rules then in effect; but when the rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the point at issue, then the Judge shall consider game-custom and the spirit of the game before applying other standards.

## 216

The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered from achieving *n* points to any other state of affairs. The magnitude of *n* and the means of earning points may be changed, and rules that establish a winner when play cannot continue may be enacted and (while they are mutable) be amended or repealed.

## 217

If the rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or if the legality of a move cannot be determined with finality, or if by the Judge's best reasoning, not overruled, a move appears equally legal and illegal, then the first player unable to complete a turn is the winner.

This rule takes precedence over every other rule determining the winner.

## 218

Persons wishing to become players may request to do so publicly. Within 24 hours of the request, if no player has publicly objected or privately objected (to a server moderator or administrator) to a player joining the game, that player will join the game. If a player has objected, a vote is immediately held on whether or not the person joins the game. If there is a majority vote in favor after 24 hours of the start of the vote, that player will join the game.

Persons may not pretend to be multiple players at once. Persons that are found to have done this are banned from the game.

## 219

Players that are required by the rules to perform an action have a total of 48 hours to perform said action unless otherwise specified. A player that does not perform said action within the allotted 48 hours becomes inactive until either they do perform said action or said action becomes impossible to perform.

## 303

Proposals are not allowed to distinguish those who voted for it, those who voted against it, or those who did not vote on it from each other.
