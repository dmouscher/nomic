# Rules

## 101 (IMMUTABLE)
All players must always abide by all the rules then in effect, in the form in which they are then in effect. The rules in the Initial Set are in effect whenever a game begins. The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (immutable) and 201-213 (mutable).

## 102 (IMMUTABLE)
Initially rules in the 100's are immutable and rules in the 200's are mutable. Rules subsequently enacted or transmuted (that is, changed from immutable to mutable or vice versa) may be immutable or mutable regardless of their numbers, and rules in the Initial Set may be transmuted regardless of their numbers.

## 103 (IMMUTABLE)
A rule-change is any of the following: (1) the enactment, repeal, or amendment of a mutable rule; (2) the enactment, repeal, or amendment of an amendment of a mutable rule; or (3) the transmutation of an immutable rule into a mutable rule or vice versa.

## 104 (IMMUTABLE)
All rule-changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on. They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required number of votes.

## 105 (IMMUTABLE)
Every player is an eligible voter. Every eligible voter must participate in every vote on rule-changes.

## 106 (IMMUTABLE)
All proposed rule-changes shall be written down before they are voted on. If they are adopted, they shall guide play in the form in which they were voted on.

## 107 (IMMUTABLE)
No rule-change may take effect earlier than the moment of the completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording explicitly states otherwise. No rule-change may have retroactive application.

## 108 (IMMUTABLE)
Each proposed rule-change shall be given a number for reference. The numbers shall begin with 301, and each rule-change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next successive integer, whether or not the proposal is adopted.

If a rule is repealed and reenacted, it receives the number of the proposal to reenact it. If a rule is amended or transmuted, it receives the number of the proposal to amend or transmute it. If an amendment is amended or repealed, the entire rule of which it is a part receives the number of the proposal to amend or repeal the amendment.

## 109 (IMMUTABLE)
Rule-changes that transmute immutable rules into mutable rules may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among the eligible voters. Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be stated explicitly in a proposal to take effect.

## 110 (IMMUTABLE)
In a conflict between a mutable and an immutable rule, the immutable rule takes precedence and the mutable rule shall be entirely void. For the purposes of this rule a proposal to transmute an immutable rule does not "conflict" with that immutable rule.

## 111 (IMMUTABLE)
If a rule-change as proposed is unclear, ambiguous, paradoxical, or destructive of play, or if it arguably consists of two or more rule-changes compounded or is an amendment that makes no difference, or if it is otherwise of questionable value, then the other players may suggest amendments or argue against the proposal before the vote. A reasonable time must be allowed for this debate. The proponent decides the final form in which the proposal is to be voted on and, unless the Judge has been asked to do so, also decides the time to end debate and vote.

## 112 (IMMUTABLE)
The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered from achieving n points to any other state of affairs. The magnitude of n and the means of earning points may be changed, and rules that establish a winner when play cannot continue may be enacted and (while they are mutable) be amended or repealed.

## 113 (IMMUTABLE)
A player always has the option to forfeit the game rather than continue to play or incur a game penalty. No penalty worse than losing, in the judgment of the player to incur it, may be imposed.

## 114 (IMMUTABLE)
There must always be at least one mutable rule. The adoption of rule-changes must never become completely impermissible.

## 115 (IMMUTABLE)
Rule-changes that affect rules needed to allow or apply rule-changes are as permissible as other rule-changes. Even rule-changes that amend or repeal their own authority are permissible. No rule-change or type of move is impermissible solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a rule.

## 116 (IMMUTABLE)
Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a rule is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the rules, which is permitted only when a rule or set of rules explicitly or implicitly permits it.

## 201
Players shall alternate in alphabetical order by surname, taking one whole turn apiece. Turns may not be skipped or passed, and parts of turns may not be omitted. All players begin with zero points.

## 204
If and when rule-changes can be adopted without unanimity, the players who vote against winning proposals shall receive 10 points each.

## 205
An adopted rule-change takes full effect at the moment of the completion of the vote that adopted it.

## 206
When a proposed rule-change is defeated, the player who proposed it loses 10 points.

## 207
Each player always has exactly one vote.

## 208
The winner is the first player to achieve 200 (positive) points.

## 210
If two or more mutable rules conflict with one another, or if two or more immutable rules conflict with one another, then the rule with the lowest ordinal number takes precedence.

If at least one of the rules in conflict explicitly says of itself that it defers to another rule (or type of rule) or takes precedence over another rule (or type of rule), then such provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining precedence.

If two or more rules claim to take precedence over one another or to defer to one another, then the numerical method again governs.

## 211
If players disagree about the legality of a move or the interpretation or application of a rule, then the player preceding the one moving is to be the Judge and decide the question. Disagreement for the purposes of this rule may be created by the insistence of any player. This process is called invoking Judgment.

When Judgment has been invoked, the next player may not begin his or her turn without the consent of a majority of the other players.

The Judge's Judgment may be overruled only by a unanimous vote of the other players taken before the next turn is begun. If a Judge's Judgment is overruled, then the player preceding the Judge in the playing order becomes the new Judge for the question, and so on, except that no player is to be Judge during his or her own turn or during the turn of a team-mate.

Unless a Judge is overruled, one Judge settles all questions arising from the game until the next turn is begun, including questions as to his or her own legitimacy and jurisdiction as Judge.

New Judges are not bound by the decisions of old Judges. New Judges may, however, settle only those questions on which the players currently disagree and that affect the completion of the turn in which Judgment was invoked. All decisions by Judges shall be in accordance with all the rules then in effect; but when the rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the point at issue, then the Judge shall consider game-custom and the spirit of the game before applying other standards.

## 212
If the rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or if the legality of a move cannot be determined with finality, or if by the Judge's best reasoning, not overruled, a move appears equally legal and illegal, then the first player unable to complete a turn is the winner.

This rule takes precedence over every other rule determining the winner.

## 302
A rule-change is adopted if and only if a simple majority of eligible voters vote for it.

## 303
Proposals may not be changed once they are initially proposed in the #voting channel. The wording of a proposal may not change from the time of its creation until the time that it is either accepted or rejected. Proposals marked with (edited) are considered moot until re-proposed. If a change is to be made to a proposal the proposer must resubmit the proposal to #voting. There will be a limit of 3 reproposals after which point the rule will be considered not accepted and the turn will move to the next player.

Only the most recent proposal to be voted on in a turn may be scored taking precedence over both Rule 206 and Rule 304.

## 304
One turn consists of two parts in this order: (1) proposing one rule-change and having it voted on, and (2) setting all players' scores to 0.

## 306
If a player fails to cast a vote within thirty-six (36) hours of the start of a vote or make a proposal within thirty-six (36) hours of the start of their turn, that player becomes Inactive.

Inactive persons are suspended from the game during the duration of their inactivity and the game acts as though there is one fewer player. An Inactive person is not a player and consequently cannot vote, take turns, or take any other action reserved for players. This person will gain the 'Inactive' role.

An Inactive person can end their inactivity and resume their status as a player by:
* Attempting to cast a vote: This action immediately removes their Inactive status, and their vote is treated as though it was cast while the voter was a Player.
* Attempting to make a proposal: This action immediately removes their Inactive status, and their proposal will be treated as though it was cast while that person was a Player. This action can only be taken if it would be their turn to make a proposal (no voting is happening and no proposal has been proposed already).
* Announcing they are no long inactive: This action immediately removes their 'Inactive' status. This action can only be taken if the other two are not able to be taken.

A player may choose to manually become Inactive at any time by publicly announcing their intention to do so. 
If a player becomes Inactive during their turn their turn ends immediately, superseding Rule 201.

## 307
All players start out with 0 gold.

All classless players choose exactly one of the eligible classes from the list below as soon as they are able to. A player that has already chosen their class can change their class to another class on the list below during their turn for 100 gold. Players cannot spend more gold than they have.

The eligible classes are:
* Cephalopodracer
* Extreme Accountant
* DOG
* Cowboy
* Miss Nomic
* Dancesassin
* Chaos Mage

## 308
When this rule comes into effect, all rules that reference any rule that has been amended are updated to reflect the current number of the referenced rules. This does not change the numbering of the updated rules.

When a rule receives a new number, all rules that reference said rule are updated to reflect the new numbering. This does not change the numbering of the updated rules.

## 310
Players may only change their vote three times  per proposal/reproposal. If a player wishes to change their vote then they must resubmit their vote to the #voting channel. If a vote is marked with (edited)  it is not counted as a vote. Players may not delete their votes under any circumstances. If a player deletes a vote (even one that has been edited and does not count) it will be treated as a non vote.

If a player breaks any part of this rule they will lose their player status for the turn that they deleted their vote as well as the turn of the next vote.

## 313
Players will receive 5 gold for voting on the final proposal proposed each turn. Players will receive 10 gold if the proposal they propose on their turn passes.

## 314
When a Judge makes a Judgement, that Judge must also write and publish an Opinion concerning said Judgement. Each Opinion is assigned two dot-separated numbers as a unique identifier. The first number is the number of the proposal that was, is, or will be voted on on the turn that the Judgement that the Opinion concerns was made. The second number is the number of Judgements that were made between the start of the turn and the time that the Judgement that the Opinion concerns was made, including the Judgement itself.

An Opinion must include all the following sections:
* A section explaining the rules disagreement that prompted the Judgement (e.g. "Alice claims that she can and has unilaterally set Bob's gold total to zero under Rule 116. Bob claims that gold totals are regulated and that Alice cannot set his gold total.")
* A section stating the Judge's Judgement, to be worded as if the Judgement was a rule or a paragraph in a rule (e.g. "Players are not permitted to unilaterally and arbitrarily change gold totals.")
* A section justifying the Judge's Judgement (e.g. "Anything that is mentioned in the ruleset is considered to be regulated for the purposes of applying Rule 116. Any alternative interpretation would mean that anyone would be able to instantly win the game using only the initial ruleset. Gold is mentioned in Rule 307.")
* A section stating the consequences of the Judge's Judgement as it applies to the initial disagreement (e.g "Therefore, Alice's setting of Bob's gold total to zero is invalidated.")
* A section enumerating the rules that are relevant to the disagreement and subsequent Judgement (e.g. "Relevant Rules: 116, 307")

In accordance with Rule 211, a previous Opinion sets a non-binding precedent for future Judges. Opinions may use older Opinions as part of the section justifying the Judgement, but may also ignore or even contradict them. If any previous Opinions are referenced, a section enumerating all referenced Opinions by their identifiers is required.

This rule still applies to Opinions concerning overruled Judgements; however, these Opinions will be marked as overruled, and cannot be used as described in the previous paragraph.

## 316
Any player may choose to form a political party only during their turn. To propose a political party the player whose turn it is must have a name. The name of the party can only be changed after the party is fully established and only by a unanimous vote from all party players. Political parties must be proposed in #game. Political parties cannot have the same name as any other party. 

After a party is proposed, other players may request to join it in #game. The players of the proposed party then vote to determine if that player is allowed to join. A player is accepted if there is a majority vote to allow that player into the proposed party. The proposed party is only created once there are 2 other players that have been accepted; however, players may still request to join a fully-formed party. Players can only be in one political party at a time. A political party may exist only if there are 3 or more players in that party, and is automatically dissolved if it has fewer than 3 players after 24 consecutive hours. If a player wishes to leave a political party then it will cost them 30 gold; that gold is added to that party's treasury. Political parties cannot have more than 3 members.
If all players in a political party vote unanimously on a rule-change, then said political party becomes an eligible voter for that vote only, voting the same as the other votes from that party. If any player in a party changes or deletes their vote after said vote is cast in #voting, then that party cannot be an eligible voter for that vote. If any member of a party is not a player, then that party cannot be an eligible voter.

When this amendment comes into effect, all party treasuries are set to 0 gold. When a party is created, its party treasury is set to 0 gold.

A party's treasury is its gold total and is under that party's exclusive control. Gold in a party's treasury can only be removed when a majority of said party's members agree to the transaction. At the end of every turn all players in a political party pay a 1 gold tax to that party's treasury. If a player cannot pay this tax, they are automatically kicked from their party instead.

At the cost of 100 gold per player, paid to the party that each player is leaving, 2 consenting players may swap from one party to another. (Paying a party X gold is defined as transferring X gold from a player's gold total to that party's treasury.)
Gold in a party's treasury can only be removed when a majority of said party's members publicly vote for the transaction in the #game channel. Not every party member must vote for a transaction to be approved. Players of a political party may vote for following transactions:
* Paying a certain amount of gold to a specific player
* Paying a certain amount of gold to a specific party

No transaction that would put a party's treasury below 0 gold may be voted on.

Players have the option of voting for multiple simultaneous transactions as though they were one transaction, so long as the combined transaction adheres to the previous paragraph.
